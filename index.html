Developing a More Efficient Learning Approach

<h2>
How I Learned Before - Procedurally
</h2>
<p>
Whenever I wanted to learn a rather advanced topic, either due to an interest in its applications or the capabilities
of projects I've seen using that knowledge, I would be hit by several obstacles. I <b>had</b> to learn the "pre-requisites"
before diving into the topic itself. So, if I wanted to learn, for instance, machine learning, I would have to learn
everything I had to about probability & statistics, linear algebra, matrix calculus, and whatever other maths that was
used in machine learning before even reading chapter 1. My approach, if I were to make an analogy, would be a very
long, tedious, procedural piece of code without any control flow. My plan when it came to learning from textbooks was to
just read the pre-requisite math/science textbooks from left to right, and then get started with the next subject. In fact,
there were often times that I would get so paralyzed by the task that my study sessions yielded less and less each time, which
essentially became a sort of procrastination. It is no surprise that this approach to learning was very inefficient, but for a long
time I stuck with it. I was too invested in being a perfectionist without consideration of time constraints or tangible goals.

<h2>
How I'm Trying to Learn Now - Recursively
</h2>
<p>
For the past month or so, I have been going through the MOOC course "Learning How to Learn" as a means of understanding and
applying better systems of learning advanced topics. The lessons I learned from the section on chunking in particular have
helped me realize that my study sessions don't have to involve me painstakingly reading a textbook page-by-page. Instead, it's
better to approach learning from two convering directions: top-down (context) and bottom-up (chunking). I found that it is important
to think of whatever I am trying to learn as a whole like a jigsaw puzzle.

Our minds can hold up to 4 slots of data at a time. Given the limited resources of the working memory, I am better suited
to understanding the big picture of what I am trying to learn first, whether if it is a certain subject in machine learning or a project
that utilizes a computer vision technique. In the context of textbooks, that would mean skimming through each chapter, reading introductions and summaries,
looking over the diagrams and pictures, and even watching youtube videos that relate to the chapter I'm trying to understand on a high level. In this
manner, I am able to create a mental framework of where the puzzle pieces of the bits of information I'm learning belong and avoid confusing
myself with the amalgamation of different chunks belonging in multiple fields. Then, I would break down the task or field into smaller sub-tasks/sub-fields. 
I keep going through this recursively until I reach a baseline where I am capable of understanding and doing the current task with confidence 
in my knowledge of the underlying pre-requisite. In this manner, I can not only start on projects in which there are underlying subjects I am unfamiliar with
, but I can also build up a stable knowledge base on top of the mental frameworks I construct with each new subject I encounter.
